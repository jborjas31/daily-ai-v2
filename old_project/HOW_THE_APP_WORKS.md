# Daily AI - How the Web App Works

**Complete walkthrough of the planned user experience and functionality**

---

## üåÖ **User Opens the App**

**First Time Experience:**
- Simple email/password login screen (no onboarding complexity)
- After successful login ‚Üí immediately redirects to Today View
- App loads with modern browser check, shows friendly error if browser too old

---

## üì± **Today View - The Heart of the App**

**What User Sees:**
- **Fixed header** showing current date and live clock (updates every 30 seconds)
- **24-hour vertical timeline** with hourly grid lines
- **Sleep blocks** (shaded areas) based on their settings (default: 11PM-6:30AM)
- **Red timeline indicator** showing current time, moving smoothly every 30 seconds
- **Task blocks** positioned at their scheduled times
- **Navigation**: Day arrows, Today button, swipe gestures (mobile)

**How Tasks Appear:**
- **Normal tasks**: Clean blocks with task name, time, duration
- **Overdue mandatory**: Subtly red, automatically move to current time
- **Overdue skippable**: Grayed out, stay in original time slot
- **Completed**: Checkmark or strikethrough
- **Overlapping**: Side-by-side (max 2 on mobile, 3 on desktop) with "+X more" indicator

## üß† **The Intelligent Scheduling Engine**

**How It Works Behind the Scenes:**
1. **Places Anchors First**: All mandatory fixed-time tasks (meetings, appointments)
2. **Resolves Dependencies**: Tasks that depend on others get scheduled after prerequisites
3. **Fills Flexible Tasks**: Intelligently slots remaining tasks in time windows by priority
4. **Crunch-Time Detection**: When time gets tight, switches to minimum durations
5. **Impossibility Check**: Alerts if more tasks than available waking hours

**Smart Countdown Feature:**
Between mandatory "anchor" tasks, shows:
- "Time Until Next Anchor: 2:15"
- "Time Required for Tasks: 3:45" 
- **Turns red when time crunch detected**

---

## ‚úã **User Interactions**

**Creating Tasks:**
- **Timeline Creation**: Tap/click empty timeline spaces ‚Üí instant task creation modal
- **Add Button**: Floating action button (mobile) or header button (desktop)
- **Modal Opens**: Full-screen (mobile) or centered (desktop) with all task options

**Task Properties User Sets:**
- Task name and description
- Duration (normal + crunch-time minimum)
- Scheduling type: Fixed time OR flexible time window
- Time window: Morning/Afternoon/Evening/Anytime (if flexible) $$ I want tasks to have 2 time options: first option is to set the start time and end time and automatically calculates duration (or set start time and duration and automatically calculate end time); second option is to add a time window of when the task needs to be generally completed. for example, task "go to town hall" can be completed any time between 9am-12pm, so set a time window of "morning".
- Priority 1-5, Mandatory vs Skippable
- Dependencies (must complete X before this)
- Recurrence rules (daily/weekly/monthly)

**Smart Defaults:**
- Priority 3, Duration 30min, Flexible scheduling
- Time window auto-detected from creation time
- Skippable by default

---

## üìö **Task Library - Command Center**

**Organized Sections:**
- **Overdue Tasks**: Red alerts for mandatory, grayed for skippable
- **Active Tasks**: Current and recurring, sorted by priority
- **Completed**: Recent completions first
- **Skipped**: Tasks deliberately skipped with reasons
- **Deleted**: Soft-deleted tasks (can recover)

**Features:**
- **Search**: Live filtering as you type (searches names + descriptions)
- **Filters**: Mandatory vs Skippable, Time windows
- **Dependencies**: Shows which tasks are blocked waiting for others

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Settings - Simple Configuration**

- **Sleep Settings**: Duration, wake time, sleep time
- **Time Adjustment**: Manual offset for daylight saving (simple +/- hours)
- **Data Management**: Basic backup/export options
$$ Skip backup/export options for now$$

---

## üîÑ **Real-Time Intelligence**

**Every 30 Seconds the App:**
- Updates current time display
- Moves red timeline indicator
- Checks for newly overdue tasks
- Updates countdown timers
- Recalculates tight schedules

**When You Complete/Edit Tasks:**
- **Immediately saves** to Firebase with loading feedback
- **Automatically reschedules** flexible tasks if conflicts arise
- **Notifies other tabs** if you have multiple windows open
- **Queues for offline sync** if no internet

---

## üì±üíª **Responsive Design Flow**

**Mobile (320-767px):**
- Bottom navigation tabs
- Full-screen modals
- Swipe day navigation
- Large touch targets (44px minimum)
- Stacked task blocks
- Compact header

**Desktop (1024px+):**
- Top navigation or sidebar
- Hover states and keyboard shortcuts
- Click-to-create with "+" indicators
- Side-by-side modal layouts
- Multiple task columns
- Full-featured header

---

## üîå **Offline-First Architecture**

**What Happens Offline:**
- Shows previously loaded tasks
- Can complete/skip tasks (stored in local queue)
- Creates new tasks (saved locally)
- Visual indicator shows "offline" status

**When Connection Returns:**
- Auto-syncs all pending changes
- Uses "last-write-wins" for conflicts
- Shows success notifications

---

## üèóÔ∏è **Technical Architecture Flow**

**Data Flow:**
1. **Firebase Auth** ‚Üí User login/session
2. **Firestore** ‚Üí Task templates and instances
3. **IndexedDB** ‚Üí Offline storage and caching
4. **LocalStorage** ‚Üí Settings and UI state
5. **BroadcastChannel** ‚Üí Multi-tab synchronization

**Security:**
- User-scoped Firestore rules (users can only access their data)
- No sensitive data in frontend code
- Secure authentication with Firebase

---

## üéØ **Advanced Scenarios**

**Dependency Chain Example:**
- Create: "Do Laundry" ‚Üí "Iron Clothes" (depends on laundry) ‚Üí "Pack Trip" (depends on ironing)
- Mark laundry complete at 10 AM
- App automatically schedules ironing in afternoon
- Pack Trip only becomes available after ironing could finish
$$ Don't make this feature too strict $$

**Time Crunch Example:**
- 9:50 AM, 10-minute client meeting at 10 AM
- Shower task needs 15 minutes normally, 5 minutes minimum  
- App detects crunch: "Time Crunch! A 5-minute shower is possible"
$$ I like this, but make sure not to clutter the app with too many messages. Be smart about alerts and messages.$$

**Impossible Day Example:**
- 8-hour sleep + 9 hours of mandatory tasks = impossible
- App shows: "Schedule Conflict Alert" with suggestions to adjust sleep/wake times

---

## üöÄ **Error Handling & User Experience**

**When Things Go Wrong:**
- **Simple browser alerts** for errors (no complex toast systems)
- **User-friendly messages**: "Network error. Please check connection."
- **Loading indicators** during all Firebase operations
- **Console logging** for debugging
- **Never crashes** - all operations wrapped in try/catch

**Multi-Tab Coordination:**
- Changes in one tab ‚Üí notifications in others
- Tab switching ‚Üí automatic data refresh
- Real-time Firebase updates ‚Üí synchronized across tabs
$$ I don't really plan on having the app open on multiple tabs, but definitely will use it across devices. Would it still be worth it to implement multi-tab support?$$
---

## üìä **Performance & Modern Features**

**Fast & Smooth:**
- **Modern browsers only** (Chrome 100+, Firefox 100+, Safari 15.4+)
- **ES6 modules** without build system complexity
- **Cached calculations** - only recalculates when tasks change
- **Service Worker** for PWA offline functionality
- **30-second update cycles** prevent performance issues

---

## üé® **Visual Design Experience**

**"Calm Productivity" Aesthetic:**
- Clean, minimalist interface with generous whitespace
- Modern blue primary (#3B82F6) with neutral grays
- Soft shadows and rounded corners (8-16px)
- Smooth micro-animations
- Inter font for readability, JetBrains Mono for times
