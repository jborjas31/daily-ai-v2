# Daily AI V2 — Master Project Blueprint (Modern Next.js)

This blueprint captures the up‑to‑date plan and architecture for the modernized Daily AI app. It supersedes the legacy blueprint under `old_project/PROJECT_MASTER_BLUEPRINT.md` while preserving its intent: a calm, responsive, offline‑friendly daily task manager with an intelligent schedule.

## 1) Project Overview

- Core mission: Create a living schedule that respects anchors, dependencies, and user intent; make small adjustments fast and safe.
- Audience: Single user, personal productivity on phone/tablet/laptop/desktop.
- Pillars: Simple data model, pure domain logic, resilient offline UX, predictable time handling (local time only).

Product principles (reduce mental load)
- Anchor‑first day planning: place mandatory fixed items (appointments/meetings) as anchors, then schedule everything else around them.
- Sleep‑bounded schedule: respect a daily sleep target (default 7.5h) and plan only within the wake window; allow per‑day overrides.
- Importance first: prioritize high‑priority tasks; skippable tasks yield first under time pressure.
- Defaults that help: sensible priorities, windows, durations; ask for choices only when needed (scope dialog, triage prompts).
- Feedback without noise: one‑line advisories and countdowns; minimal toasts; no alert spam.

## 2) Architecture (V2)

- Frontend: Next.js 15 (App Router) + React 19 + Tailwind 4
- State: Zustand with `immer` and `devtools`
- Domain: Pure TypeScript modules in `src/lib/domain/scheduling/*` (Recurrence, SchedulingEngine)
- Data/Auth: Firebase modular SDK (Auth + Firestore) with offline persistence enabled
- Hosting: Firebase Hosting with static export (`output: 'export'`); predeploy runs `npm run build`
- PWA: Manifest + icons (no custom service worker in MVP)
- CI: GitHub Actions (lint, typecheck, test, build). Branch protection requires “CI / build-and-test”

CSR/SSR boundaries
- Time‑sensitive logic (clock, auth, Firestore, store, scheduling) runs on the client.
- Server components used only for static shell/layout.

## 3) Data Model (per user)

- `users/{uid}` — Settings: `desiredSleepDuration` (hours), `defaultWakeTime`, `defaultSleepTime`
- `users/{uid}/tasks/{id}` — Task templates (recurrence, priority, mandatory, fixed vs flexible, durations, dependencies)
- Optional task fields (to reduce mental load without extra noise):
  - `energy?: 'deep' | 'shallow'` (bias placement; UI optional)
  - `context?: 'home' | 'errands' | 'computer' | string` (bias placement; UI optional)
  - `deadline?: string` (ISO date; small badge only, no alerts by default)
  - `bufferMinutes?: number` (per‑task override for small transition buffers; default comes from settings)
  - `category?: string` (lightweight grouping/search)
- `users/{uid}/task_instances/{id}` — Daily modifications/overrides
  - Deterministic ID: `inst-{YYYY-MM-DD}-{templateId}`
  - Fields: `status` (pending/completed/skipped/postponed), `modifiedStartTime?: 'HH:MM'`, `completedAt?`
- `users/{uid}/daily_schedules/{YYYY-MM-DD}` — Cached computed schedule (best‑effort)

Notes
- All times are local device time strings (`'HH:MM'`, 24‑hour). No time zones.
- Firestore offline persistence allows optimistic UI and automatic sync when online.
 - Extra fields (energy/context/deadline/buffer) are optional and off by default in UI; they influence placement quietly.

## 4) Application Surface

Routes (App Router)
- `/today` — Timeline (24h grid with sleep shading, now‑line, scheduled blocks) + basic list
  - Header: current date + live clock; Previous/Next/Today controls, native date picker; swipe left/right on mobile
  - Up Next strip: one clear next step (anchor or best flexible) with Start / Can’t do
  - Smart countdown between anchors (compact, mobile‑friendly)
- `/library` — Template management (enable/disable, duplicate, soft delete, edit/create)
- `/settings` — Editable settings form with validation and Firestore persistence
- `/login` — Email/password auth; guards redirect unauthenticated users

Key Components
- `Timeline` — Renders schedule; supports vertical drag to reposition non‑mandatory blocks
- `TaskList` — Pending/Completed/Skipped with Complete/Undo toggle (write‑through to instances)
- `TaskModal` — Minimal template editor
- `ConfirmDialog` — Radix‑based confirm for deletes
- `AppHeader` / `AppNav` — Shared layout shell

## 5) Scheduling Engine (Pure)

- Inputs: `settings`, `templates`, `instances`, `date`, optional `dailyOverride` (sleep) and `currentTime`
- Algorithm (summary):
  1) Place anchors (fixed tasks) and manual overrides (`instances.modifiedStartTime`)
  2) Resolve dependencies (topological order)
  3) Schedule flexible tasks into windows (morning/afternoon/evening/anytime)
  4) Use min durations in “crunch” cases near anchors
  5) Detect impossibilities (mandatory sum > waking window)
- Outputs: `schedule[]`, `sleepSchedule`, totals, advisories, success/error

Manual overrides
- If an instance has `modifiedStartTime` and is not completed/skipped, it anchors that task at the chosen time and is excluded from flexible placement.

Sleep‑bounded day & overbooked handling
- Day is planned inside the wake window derived from desired sleep (default 7.5h); `dailyOverride` can tweak specific days.
- When tasks exceed time, surface “impossible schedule” and enable Triage options (see Phase 10).

## 6) Timeline Drag‑and‑Drop (MVP scope)

- Tech: Framer Motion for light client‑side DnD (no external DnD framework)
- Behavior:
  - Non‑mandatory blocks are draggable vertically
  - Snap to 5‑minute increments
  - On drop, store calls `setInstanceStartTime(date, templateId, 'HH:MM')`
  - Optimistic local update, write‑through to Firestore, schedule cache invalidated
- Constraints: Mandatory blocks are not draggable in MVP. Cross‑day dragging is out of scope.

## 7) Design System — Calm Productivity

- Visual: Minimalist, ample whitespace, soft shadows, rounded corners, micro‑animations
- Colors: Primary `#3B82F6`; Success `#10B981`; Warning `#F59E0B`; Error `#EF4444`; neutral ramp from light to dark
- Typography: Inter (primary), JetBrains Mono for time; 12–30px scale
- Breakpoints: Mobile 320+, Tablet 768+, Laptop 1024+, Desktop 1440+

## 8) Security, Stability, UX

- Firebase Security Rules: User‑scoped access only
- Route guards: Unauthenticated users are redirected to `/login`
- Errors: Toaster feedback via `sonner`; try/catch on async writes; optimistic revert on failures
- Network: Firestore offline persistence; best‑effort schedule cache

## 9) Developer Experience

Environment
- Node 20 (matches CI). Vitest stability is best under Node 20
- Required env vars in `.env.local`:
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID`

Scripts
- `dev`, `build`, `start`, `lint`, `typecheck`, `test`, `test:watch`
- Firebase Hosting deploy runs `npm run build` automatically (predeploy)

Structure (key)
- `src/app/*` pages; `src/components/*` UI
- `src/store/useAppStore.ts` state/actions/selectors (Zustand)
- `src/lib/domain/scheduling/*` pure modules
- `src/lib/data/*` Firestore helpers: `templates`, `instances`, `schedules`, `settings`

CI/CD
- GitHub Actions: lint/typecheck/test/build on PRs
- Branch protection requires status check “CI / build-and-test” and up‑to‑date branches

## 10) Testing

- Vitest unit tests for domain modules and store behavior
- Store tests cover `setUser`/reset, settings impact on schedule, and toggle create/undo
- Keep Firestore out of unit tests (pure store); I/O verified via integration/manual

## 11) Roadmap (Post‑MVP)

- Timeline DnD enhancements: resize handles, mandatory override flow, keyboard nudges
- Shortcuts: quick actions (complete/skip), focus cycle, date navigation
- Background sync/service worker for push‑style refresh
- Advanced conflict/advisory UX
- Settings expansion (categories, quiet hours, DST offsets)
- Performance analytics (Web Vitals + custom timings)

## 12) Differences vs Legacy Blueprint

- Framework: React/Next.js instead of vanilla DOM modules
- State: Zustand store replaces custom bus; selectors drive UI
- Data SDK: Firebase modular SDK, persistence enabled
- Build/Deploy: Static export, Firebase Hosting predeploy build
- Tests: Vitest added for recurrence, scheduling engine, and store
- Manual overrides: `modifiedStartTime` anchors introduced to integrate Timeline DnD with scheduling

This blueprint is the single source of truth for Daily AI V2. Use `docs/v2-migration-plan.md` and `docs/MIGRATION_STATUS.md` for tactical steps and progress tracking.

## 13) Steps To Complete (Modernized From Legacy Phases)

The legacy blueprint (see `old_project/README.md`) outlines several phases. Below are the remaining items, adapted to the modern V2 stack, grouped with concise, testable steps.

Phase 4 — Responsive Task Management (Completed)
- Status: Completed. See `docs/phase-4-action-plan.md` for implementation details and tests.
- Highlights shipped:
  - Accessible modals (title/description wiring, focus management) and mobile full‑screen layouts.
  - Timeline click seeds “New Task” modal (time/window prefill) with a floating “New Task” button.
  - Inline validation + disabled submit while invalid/saving; double‑submit guarded.
  - Today list actions: Complete, Skip, Postpone, and Undo with optimistic updates and consistent toasts.
  - Recurrence edit scope dialog supporting “Only this / This and future (split) / All”.

Phase 5 — Library & Search
- Client search (name/description) with debounce; priority sort toggle.
- Category sections: Active, Inactive/Deleted; optionally add Skipped, Completed, Overdue, and “Recently modified”.
- Filters: Mandatory vs Skippable; Time window (morning/afternoon/evening/anytime); combine with search.
- Dependency indicator: show when a template is blocked by another (and prerequisite status).
- Acceptance:
  - Typing in search filters results live (name + description) with debounce (~200–300ms).
  - Filters combine predictably; clearing filters restores full list.
  - Dependency badge/line visible where `dependsOn` exists; status hints when prerequisite not satisfied.

Phase 6 — Real‑Time, Date Nav & Overlaps
- Date navigation: Previous/Next day, Today button, native date picker; swipe left/right on mobile.
- Overdue policy: Mandatory overdue snaps to “now” (visual placement); Skippable overdue stays grayed at original slot.
- Overlap rendering: share width for simultaneous blocks (mobile up to 2 lanes, desktop up to 3) with “+X more”.
- Update cadence: ensure now‑line/clock/countdown/overdue checks tick ~30s without jank on mobile.
- Acceptance:
  - Header shows current date + live clock; clicking Today recenters and sets date to today.
  - Prev/Next (and swipe) update `currentDate` and re-render Timeline/List immediately; now‑line shown only on today.
  - Selecting a date via native date input updates `currentDate` and re-renders Timeline/List; keyboard accessible and respects locale.
  - Mandatory overdue blocks render in red tint and visually re-seat at current time (no data mutation); skippable overdue render grayed.
  - Overlapping blocks never cover; excess beyond lane capacity shows “+X more” (tap/click may list hidden items).
 - Up Next strip (calm focus):
   - Shows exactly one next step: current anchor or best flexible task for “now”.
   - Two actions: Start; Can’t do → inline Skip/Postpone (no modal).
 - Small buffers around anchors:
   - Default 5–10 min transition before/after anchors (faint visual spacing); per‑task override via `bufferMinutes`.
 - Smart gaps (quiet micro‑fillers):
   - In gaps ≥ 5 min, show a tiny “Use gap” pill in the gap; tap to fill with a short task. No global suggestions.

Phase 7 — Offline Enhancements (beyond Firestore persistence)
- Optional write queue wrapper for user‑visible syncing states and retry/backoff; conflict toast with “retry/undo”.
- Background sync (post‑MVP): service worker integration to flush queue when the app is reopened.

Phase 8 — Smart Countdown & Advisories
- Countdown between anchors: show “Time Until Next Anchor” and “Time Required for Tasks in this window”; turn red when crunch.
- Minimal advisories: surface only meaningful notices (e.g., “Using min duration for X”, “Impossible schedule”).
- Placement: compact in header or sticky at top of Timeline; mobile-friendly.
- Acceptance:
  - Countdown updates with the 30s tick and reflects schedule changes promptly.
  - Advisory budget: at most one visible at a time; auto-fades; concise; no toast spam.
  - Daily Top 3 (optional, calm): small check chips; biases placement earlier; no banners or alerts.

Phase 9 — Scheduling Engine Enhancements
- Cross‑midnight tasks: allow windows/anchors to span midnight; ensure sleep boundaries are respected.
- Circular dependency detection: surface readable error/advisory if a cycle exists.
- Performance guardrails: soft cap and warning for 100+ templates/instances per day.

Phase 10 — Triage Advisor
- “Impossible Day” assistant: when mandatory > awake or conflicts persist, propose minimal edits with one‑click apply.
  - Options:
    - Use min durations for flexible tasks likely to fit before the next anchor.
    - Postpone/skip lowest‑priority skippable tasks (suggest a shortlist).
    - Adjust sleep for that day via `dailyOverride` (± small shift) with preview of regained/consumed time.
    - If a recurring task’s change only makes sense going forward, propose “This and future” split.
  - Acceptance:
    - Assistant appears only when schedule is impossible or crunch persists beyond threshold.
    - Shows time impact per option and applies changes optimistically with clear toasts.

Phase 11 — Dynamic Scheduler
- Live adapt on user actions (complete/skip/postpone/drag): subtle re‑seat flexible tasks; show brief advisories.
- Keyboard nudges for Timeline (↑/↓ in 5‑min steps) with the same write‑through path as drag.

Phase 12 — PWA & Polish
- Add a minimal service worker (workbox/vite‑plugin‑pwa) for offline shell caching of static assets.
- Install prompt polish; icon/manifest checks; theme color consistency.
- Performance telemetry: Web Vitals + lightweight custom timings for schedule compute.
 - Settings “Keep it Calm” preset: toggles for countdown visibility, micro‑fillers, overdue tint intensity, advisory frequency. Default is low‑intensity.

QA & Tests (ongoing)
- Expand unit tests around SchedulingEngine (cross‑midnight, overlaps, advisories) and store actions.
- Add focused component tests for Timeline rendering variants (overlaps, overdue, drag snap) where feasible.
