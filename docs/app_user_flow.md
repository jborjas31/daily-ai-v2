this is how i want the web app to work for me as a new user. i create a new profile and log in. there are default settings, like sleep duration and sleep times. the goal of the web app is to help me get all the tasks done every day during the available time because I want to get 7.5 hrs of sleep. i want to start by easily adding recurring tasks, e.g. shower daily for 15 mins in the morning, eat breakfast daily for 30 misn in the morning after shower, eat lunch daily for 30 mins in the afternoon, take out the trash on mondays in the afternoon, eat dinner daily for 30 mins in the evening, clean up daily for 30 mins in the evening, get ready for bed daily for 15 mins in the evening. if all those tasks fit within the avaialable time then great. i want to also easily add one-off tasks throughout the day. e.g. go to Kroger for 30 mins to buy food. the web app smartly adjusts as needed. the idea is that the web app will help me know and visualize what i need to do and get done every day. some tasks will be mandatory and act like anchor tasks. for example, on a tuesday, i have a doctor's appointment at 8am. so i have to wake up earlier and the morning tasks adjust accordinly if they're flexible, e.g. they move up or are postponed until after the doctor appointment. sometimes, there will be too many tasks during the day and their durations have to be adjusted or the user can skip or postpone some of them. the user can also adjust the sleep time/duration as needed, sometimes to go to sleep earlier/later or wake up earlier/later
